This is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value, used to verify data integrity and password hashing.\n",

    "1. **Problem 1**: Implementing the core bitwise functions used in SHA-256\n",
    "2. **Problem 2**: Calculating the K constants from the cube roots of prime numbers\n",
    "3. **Problem 3**: Creating a message padding and block parsing function\n",

    "# Problem 1: Binary Words and Operations\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Following the Secure Hash Standard PDF, we implement seven bitwise functions that are fundamental to the SHA hashing algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps\n",
    "1. Add the helper functions - before adding the main 7 bitwise functions, these are utility functions for rotating and shifting bits:\n",
    "   - `rotr(x, n)` - Rotate right\n",
    "   - `rotl(x, n)` - Rotate left\n",
    "   - `shr(x, n)` - Right shift with zeros\n",
    " \n",
    "2. Implement the 7 main bitwise functions directly from the NIST FIPS PDF specification:\n",
    "   - `Parity(x, y, z)` - Parity operation\n",
    "   - `Ch(x, y, z)` - Choose operation\n",
    "   - `Maj(x, y, z)` - Majority operation\n",
    "   - `Sigma0(x) Σ₀` & `Sigma1(x) Σ₁` - Uppercase sigma functions (rotation based)\n",
    "   - `sigma0(x) σ₀` & `sigma1(x) σ₁` - Lowercase sigma functions (shift based)\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Verify Implementation - test each function to ensure that they work as expected.\n",
    "   - Checks against known values\n",
    "   - Verify that the bitwise behaviour works as expected\n",
    "   - Compare results with specific examples"
   ]
  },

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Approach\n",
    "### Use of numpy.uint32\n",
    "We use `np.uint32()` to:\n",
    "- Enforce 32-bit boundaries to the outputs\n",
    "- This ensures a consistent behaviour across different systems\n",
    "- Uses the NIST specification assuming the use of 32-bit words\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, integers can get very large so we need to make sure that all outputs are configured to be 32-bit unsigned integers so we can apply the SHA rules and specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rotation & Shifting\n",
    "We have two types of bit operations in these functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rotation (ROTR, ROTL)**: \n",
    "- Bits wrap around in a circle\n",
    "- No bits are lost in the operation\n",
    "- Used when we need to preserve all information while mixing bits\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shifting (SHR)**:\n",
    "- Bits are dropped off one end\n",
    "- Information is intentionally discarded\n",
    "- Used when we want diffusion (spreading the change across bits)\n",
    "\n",
    "In SHA-256:\n",
    "- Rotations appear in Sigma functions (uppercase - need to preserve all bits)\n",
    "- Shifts appear in sigma functions (lowercase - intentional bit loss for diffusion)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Seven Bitwise Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement exactly 7 functions because they provide:\n",
    "- **Diffusion**: Changing one input bit affects many output bits (security)\n",
    "- **Confusion**: Input-output relationship is complex and non-linear (security)\n",
    "- **Speed**: Bitwise operations are extremely fast on all processors\n",
    "- **Cryptographic strength**: They prevent certain types of attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions come directly from Section 4.1.2."

    "# Problem 2: Fractional Parts of Cube Roots\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "From the Secure Hash Standard PDF on page 11, we will use numpy to calculate the constants used in the SHA-224 & SHA-256 algorithms.\n",
    "These are the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps:\n",
    "1. Create a `primes(n)` function that generates the first n prime numbers.\n",
    "2. Create a function to calculate the cube root of the first 64 primes.\n",
    "3. Extract the fractional part and convert to 32-bit integers.\n",
    "4. Format and display results in hexadecimal.\n",
    "5. Verify against the Secure Hash Standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "The function to generate the prime numbers uses an iterative approach. When given a number, checks each number up to that limit by testing if it has any divisions other than 1 and the number itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sieve of Eratosthenes is another approach to find prime numbers of a specific number. It will mark the multiples of each of the prime number starting from 2, leaving only prime numbers unmarked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are looking for the first 64 prime numbers I am using the iterative approach."

    "## Overview\n",
    "Create a generator function `block_parse(msg)` that process messages according to sections 5.1.1 and 5.2.1 of the Secure Hash Standard PDF.\n",
    "The function should accept a bytes object called `msg`. The message should be padded and ensure it's in a multiple of 512 or 1024 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps\n",
    "1. Check the padding requirements from the Secure Hash Standard PDF (Sections 5.1.1 & 5.2.1).\n",
    "2. Calculate the padding needed for the message.\n",
    "3. Construct the padded message -> original message + padding bits + length.\n",
    "4. Create the generator function yielding 512-bit blocks.\n",
    "5. Test with different various message lengths e.g. minimum, average and near maximum. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "The SHA-256 hashing algorithm processes messages in fixed 512-bit (64-byte) blocks. \n",
    "The actual messages can be any length, but we will need to pad the remaing length of the message so we can then set it up for hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Padding Structure from Section 5.1.1**\n",
    "\n",
    "When padding we follow a specific format:\n",
    "1. **The '1' bit**: We append `0x80` (binary: 10000000) to mark where the original message ends\n",
    "2. **Zero padding**: We add zero bytes until we're 64 bits (8 bytes) short of a 512-bit boundary\n",
    "3. **Length field**: The final 64 bits store the original message length in bits (big-endian format)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we always leave room for the 64-bit length at the end, which is why we pad to 448 bits (mod 512) rather than 512.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of a Generator Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a generator function (`yield`) rather than returning a list of blocks because:\n",
    "- **Memory efficiency**: For large messages, we don't need to store all blocks in memory at once\n",
    "- **Lazy evaluation**: Blocks are only created when needed\n",
    "- **Cleaner iteration**: The calling code can simply loop through blocks without managing indices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edge Cases Considered**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Empty message**: Still produces one block (just padding and length)\n",
    "- **Messages near block boundaries**: May require an extra block if there isn't room for padding\n",
    "- **Long messages**: The generator handles any number of blocks efficiently\n"

    "## Overview\n",
    "We are provided with 3 common passwords that have been hashed with one pass of the SHA-256 algorithm. We need to 'crack'/identify the original passwords and find out their literal strings before they were encoded and hashed.\n",
    "We will use a **Dictionary Attack**, where we will hash the most common passwords and compare them to our listed passwords until we can find a match. This type of attack works as many passwords are created with a small set of common words and patterns.\n",
    "Following that we need to suggest security improvements to make password hashes more resistant to this type of attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passwords to crack:\n",
    "1. `5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8`\n",
    "2. `873ac9ffea4dd04fa719e8920cd6938f0c23cd678af330939cff53c3d2855f34`\n",

    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps:\n",
    "1. Create a list of common passwords in a dictionary.\n",
    "2. Use the hash function from Problem 4, to hash the passwords based on the SHA-256 algorithm.\n",
    "3. Convert the target hashes into a searchable and comparable format.\n",
    "4. Iterate through each hash and compare with hashed dictionary passwords:\n",
    "   - Hash the password.\n",
    "   - Convert the resulting hash to a hex string.\n",
    "   - Compare the password from the dictionary to the 3 provided hashed passwords.\n",
    "5. Report which passwords were found and not found in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "Use a brute-force dictionary attack:\n",
    "- Iterate through the 3 hashed passwords to crack.\n",
    "- For each one, we need to test against the passwords in the dictionary:\n",
    "    - Convert them to bytes.\n",
    "    - Hash using the hash function from problem 4.\n",
    "    - Convert the computed hashes to a hex string format.\n",
    "    - Compare them against the target hashes.\n",
    "- Record the password when a match is found then move onto the next hashed password to crack."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "The 3 hashed passwords were created in a single pass of the SHA-256 algoritm.\n",
    "I used a **Dictionary Attack** to crack the passwords, by computing hashes of common passwords and comparing them to the target hashes until a match is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process\n",
    "1. We took a password from the NCSC password list (99,818) and hashed it using my own SHA-256 implementation (see Problems 3 & 4).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Each password was then padded and parsed according to the SHA-256 specification:\n",
    "   - Encoded to UTF-8 bytes\n",
    "   - Padded according to Section 5.1.1 in the PDF\n",
    "   - Parsed into 512-bit blocks using the block_parse() generator function\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each block was processed using the SHA-256 compression function (Section 6.2.2):\n",
    "   - The 7 bitwise functions (Parity, Ch, Maj, Sigma0, Sigma1, sigma0, sigma1)\n",
    "   - The 64 round constants (K values from cube roots of primes)\n",
    "   - The 8 initial hash values\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We then compare the resulting 256-bit hash to the 3 target hashes. When we find a match, we have found the likely password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works:\n",
    "The dictionary attack succeeds because:\n",
    "- **SHA-256 is predetermined**: the same text input will produce the same hash output, it makes it easy to compare\n",
    "- **Passwords were common**: all three passwords appeared in the NCSC list of passwords\n",
    "- **Modern computational speed**: hashing the 99,818 passwords only took a few moments to process on relatively standard hardware, make this search possible\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solutions\n",
    "This attack only exploits  **common passwords**. These following measures can help prevent or slow down this type of attack:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Longer passwords**: Use passwords with at least 12+ characters, mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters. Avoid common words, patterens and keyboard sequences (\"12345\" or \"asdfgh\"). Doing this would make dictionary attacks ineffective as random, longer passwords are unlikely to appear in a password list (unless exposed in a data breach).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Salting**: Add a random `salt` (random bytes) to the password before hashing it. This ensures each password produces a unique hash, even if two users have the same password. It also increases computational cost as attackers would need to test each possible password with against every possible salt value, exponentially increasing the work required.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Slow Hashing Algorithm**: Use more password specific algorithms such as bcrypt, scrypt or Argon2, these intentionally slow down hasing (taking up to 100ms per hash instead of microseconds). So in this case, testing against 99,818 passwords will take exponentially longer (days or weeks instead of minutes), making this brute force approach very impractical.\n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a version of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, following the NIST Secure Hash Standard (FIPS 180-4). The implementation demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bitwise Operations (Problem 1)**: All seven bitwise functions (Parity, Ch, Maj, Σ₀, Σ₁, σ₀, σ₁) were implemented using NumPy's uint32 type to ensure correct 32-bit behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constant Generation (Problem 2)**: The K constants were successfully derived from the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers, matching the official specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Message Padding (Problem 3)**: A generator function was created to properly pad and parse messages into 512-bit blocks according to the standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hash Computation (Problem 4)**: The compression function was implemented following Section 6.2.2, producing correct SHA-256 hashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Password Cracking (Problem 5)**: Using a dictionary attack with approximately 100,000 common passwords, all three target hashes were successfully cracked, demonstrating both the effectiveness of the implementation and the vulnerability of simple password hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "- SHA-256 is deterministic: the same input always produces the same output\n",
    "- The algorithm relies on careful bit manipulation and modular arithmetic\n",
    "- Simple password hashing (without salting) is vulnerable to dictionary attacks\n",
    "- Modern password storage should use algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2"
